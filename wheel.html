				The Empire of David prides itself on scientific breakthroughs. As such, we are proud to announce that we have made, what we consider, the ultimate scientific breakthrough of our civilization. The scientist that has discovered this breakthrough, Remriel, David's Sir of Science, named this new device the <b><i>Wheel</i></b>. The name Wheel was inspired from Viscount Johnson Wheelson, sir Remriel's mentor in the scientific field.

				Sir Arth Remriel is noted for many discoveries. He is known for researching the telegraph, printing press, and for his current research on telecommunications. He held a position at Oxford University in the city of David. After creating an exemplary resume, king David chose him as the second official Sir of Science. Of his lifelong achievements, sir Remriel has said:

				'The wonders of this world are numerous, and their meanings are complex. It would be my pleasure to be able to understand them all by my life's end. If not me, than my students.'
			</p>
			<p>
				Sir Remriel later did state that he considers his Wheel to be the greatest of his accomplishments. <i>"This Wheel could prove to be essential to post-modern movement and land-based cargo routes."</i> Was Remriel's main statement during the press conference. He spoke at length about devices he named <i>carts</i>, or <i>cars</i> that would ride atop the wheels. He even mentioned the possibility of some mechanical device that would power wheels and allow automated travel.
			</p>
			<p>
				Barring his scientific jargon, sir Remriel's passion was plain to see by all who attended his conference. While hard to understand, this amazing scientist truly believes that the Wheel is the foundation of the future of David. He assured the press that there is no exaggeration in the statement that <i>"Life as we know it will change."</i> Citizens of David, I assure you that this change will be positive. We are now entering a new age of globalization, information, and commerce. Let us ride the Wheel into the future.
