		met in our lives. One of our designers, John Cinquegrana, uploaded his very own amazing doggos,
		name Kora and Shephard shown above, and his best friends piar of doggos, Maggie and Norman shown
		above, out of gratitude. These creatures have always been very kind to us and have gotten each of
		us through very tough times. As humans, we often like to think we are the ones that take care of
		our pet canines but, in reality, they take care of us just as much. We truly love these, and all
		animals, If you feel so inclined please donate to the
