                    The Salt Wars
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A conflict has arisen in the land of David. As our empire rises from the ashes once again, we have been struck at a time most critical to our development. The ripples of this conflict will scar our history forever.

This <i>wheel</i> is used to leverage friction in order to accelerate a cart, or other object, smoothly over level ground. Read more about this breakthrough here.

                    David's response to the Coronavirus pandemic is to be swift and immediate. This disease has threatened too many people and hurt too many lives. We are ridding it from the entire empire once and for all.
