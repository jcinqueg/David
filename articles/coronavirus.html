            <p id="first">
				As a nation of the highest scientific standing, we have always prided ourself with ownership of the cutting edge of scientific discoveries. That being said, the Coronavirus, scientifically known as COVID-19, has taken us by surprise. The current death rate stands at nearly 10 citizens every hour. The recovery rate is lagging behind.
			</p>

			<p>
				Our greatest minds of scientific inquiry and research have been called together.  They totalled the affects of the Coronavirus, resulting in the chart you see to your right. These great minds worked tirelessly in our time of need and fortunately say that a solution is on the way. The COVID-19 vaccine that most of you are hoping for is on the way. To meet this end, the scientific conference ended in the formation of the Royal Research Cabinet (RRC).
			</p>
			<p>
				The RRC was formed as a task force under king David for the exact purpose of defeating the terrors of COVID-19. They have been given a large amount of funding from the royal treasury, and special access to several research labs around the country. The main hub of the RRC resides in the Capital itself, with the Sir of Science, Remriel, being the ambassador and head of the RRC. It is rumoured that some members have already began research, and that they are even directly taking samples within hospitals. While the RRC's main purpose is fighting COVID, king David was quoted as saying:
			</p>
			<p class="quote">
				'While initially formed to create a COVID-19 vaccine and preventative measures against the disease, I plan to continue the RRC even after COVID has disappeared from hospitals. Science is the future of our civilization, and deserves to be nurtured accordingly.'
			</p>
			<p>
				It seems that the RRC will be a force within Davidian politics for many years to come. Later on in the press conference king David expressed his regret in his late response to the COVID disasters. He stated as a brief excuse: <i>"I was busy playing games and being lazy and stuff. It's been hard to stay motivated once school let out and I had nothing to do."</i> While not ideal, it seems that our great government, and our resilient people, will survive this pandemic. With hope, the empire of David will be return to normality with strength and vigor.
			</p>

			<h2>Foreign Response</h2>
			<p>
				As well as creating the RRC to serve our own people in recovery from COVID-19, plans were released to assist other countries in their battle against disease. Among these tactics include research agreements, additional embassies, tourism restrictions, and more.
			</p>

			<p>
				As our closest neighbor and dear friend, the nation of Pebis was the first country we entered deliberations with.
				Lord Lucca, despite of past relations, was eager to receive aid and cooperation in fighting the pandemic. Pebian ambassador, knight Colomber, was elated at the response from lord Lucca. In his official report, knight Colomber gave an inspiring quote that came from the silver tongue of lord Lucca:
			</p>
			<p class="quote">
				'As it is written in the holy texts "sure."'
			</p>
			<p>
				King David plans to, in time, reach out to other nations as well to enter into more treaties of cooperation, as the official statement proclaims. For now, however, out northern partners of Pebis are all the friendship we can afford in these hard times. The royal office extends its hope and courage to all the citizens, not only of David, but of the world. Let us hope that we can charge through these times together. Glory be to David.
