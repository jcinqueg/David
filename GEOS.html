				As we move further and further into the age of information, we require a more and more complex infrastructure. Gone are the days of slates. Gone are the days of manual calculation. Gone are the days of Windows updates constantly interrupting official processes. The Empire of David is officially switching over, wholly, to a new and improved infrastructure.

				Many of our citizens may be wondering what an <b>Operating System</b> is. Any computer, be it a home desktop, or a student's laptop, must run an <i>Operating System</i>. MacOS and MS-DOS are two of the most popular modern operating systems. Any of the computer users out in the world are certainly familiar with these two. The professionals at <b>DaviTech Co.</b> have been using these for a long time. The empire of David, however, have made their decree. We are partnering with a new state-of-the-art operating system that is sure to be both streamline and future proof our working process.

				The Empire of David has officially switched over to the <b>Graphic Environment Operating System</b>, or GEOS. The RRC, Formed in response to the <a href="coronavirus.html">Coronavirus in David</a>, has excitedly that the GEOS is the first official national OS in David's history. This is even the first national OS in all of the world's history, yet another thing our empire has done ahead of others.
			</p>
			<p>
				GEOS was created for express use on the massively popular Commodore 64, the greatest selling computer of all time. GEOS was so revered within the software world that even the Apple &#8545 has support for it. Based on the classic DOS interface, GEOS adds a layer of graphical utility. The OS even comes packaged with a new <i>Desktop</i> feature which can support shortcuts to commonly used executables and files. Along with the desktop comes an office suite of both first and third-party applications. The most popular of these applications include geoPaint, geoCalc, geoPrint, geoProgrammer, geoPublish, geoWrite, geoRAM, and the ever important geoBASIC. BASIC 2.0 is, as you know, is the original OS packaged with your Commodore 64. While BASIC actually only directly refers to the pre-installed programming language on the Commodore 64, it has come to represent the entire system.

			<p>
				As you are definitely aware, GEOS is not just some <i>BASIC</i> OS. The GEOS is a tremendous upgrade to the Commodore 64. Unlike many other third-party applications which don't take advantage of the custom Commodore API and drivers, GEOS does. RAM expansion units, Commodore mice, RGB monitors, and more are all out-of-the-box compatible with GEOS. It's even possible to insert a Floppy Disk into your computer and have GEOS treat it as a virtual swap disk partition to increase read/write speeds in systems with low RAM. In <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/54813745/Run-Issue-30-1986-Jun" >Run Magazine</a>'s article detailing GEOS they opened with the wonderful excerpt:
			</p>
			<p class="quote">
				'<b>GEOS</b> realizes the technical potential that has been in the C-64 all along. Speed. Power. Ease of use. Sophistication. Elegant, practical applications you might expect of a high-end personal computer, all made possible with GEOS. It's so simple&#8212 but then, so was fire. <i>Once it caught on</i>.'

			<p>
				I say this heartily, GEOS is an absolutely stunning and amazing Operating System for the time it was made in. As the Commodore-64 gains traction at an unreasonable speed in the personal computer market, GEOS will become the dominant OS. DaviTech Co. has already begun issuing C64 machines to all of its workers. Here in the empire of David we pave the way for the future. Mark my words, the future will run on GEOS.

				While the future of the office world may rest squarely on the heads of <i>Berkeley Softworks</i> with their release of GEOS. We here at DaviTech have recieved word of a student at the <i>University of Helsinki</i> making on a streamlined real-time system. Linus Torvalds is an excellent student in the study of OS, and we look forward to seeing what he may create. A real-time operating system is vital for many programs seperate from batch and personal type operating systems. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Our Sir of Science Remriel expressed a unique interest in Mr Torvalds doings. We hope to encourage this progress as much as we can going forward. Offers have been made to Torvalds to take up positions in the RRC, however he has refused on the exact grounds of:

				While we were disappointed to have recieved a simple confusion over our country's nomenclature, we will continue to keep up discussion with Mr Torvalds. Praise be to Science, and may peace prosper in David.
